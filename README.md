# k8s-manifest-builder

A simple webapp for building Kubernetes resource definitions using a form.

Developed using VueJS and TailwindCSS. Built mostly as a side-project for learning, but pull requests are welcome!

**Currently (25/10):** researching how to populate the forms dynamically from JSON, so that more dynamic and complex Kubernetes objects can be created.
